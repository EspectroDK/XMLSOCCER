"# XMLSOCCER" 

Welcome to the XMLSoccer.com .net library project.

Feel free to add new functionality to the project that you think will be in the interest of others. Alternatively you can use it as a startingpoint for your own project when parsing the soccerdata from XMLSoccer.com.

Any questions or comments should be sent to either info@xmlsoccer.com or at our Facebook page @ https://www.facebook.com/xmlsoccer

Best regards
